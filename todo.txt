- Check any rspec todos
- Add the rails controller filter after every other filter!
- Add logging support
- Allow sentries to be created without a model - or specify some override behaviour to permit it, 
for example:
  authorize :index, :with => :nothing

- includable rights, e.g.

    Sentry.rights do
      create; read; update; delete
    
      manage do
        includes create, read, update, delete
        # find all the included rights on the parent
        # true if all pass
      end
    
    end
