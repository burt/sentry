Change rails before filters to follow this structure:
  
  sentry do
    authorize :index, :on => :posts
    authorize [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy], :on => lambda { get_post }
    authorize [:new, :create], :on => [:post]
  end
  


Change rights for simplification:
  
  Sentry.rights do
    
    create do
      actions :create, :new
    end
    
    read do
      default true
      actions :show, :index
    end
    
    update do
      default false
      actions :update, :edit
    end
    
    delete do
      actions destroy
    end
    
    manage do
      includes create, read, update, delete
      # find all the included rights on the parent
      # true if all pass
    end
    
  end
