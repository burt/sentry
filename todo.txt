- differentiate between current action and method in sentry

- includable rights
- array of sources to iterate over
- pass authorize into right permitted (instead of having it as an option)


Aggregate rights, e.g.
  
  Sentry.rights do
    create; read; update; delete
    
    manage do
      includes create, read, update, delete
      # find all the included rights on the parent
      # true if all pass
    end
    
  end
